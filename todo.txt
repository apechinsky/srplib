+ BindingException - an exception for binding subsystem

- consider single method in binder bind(inputObject, outputObject, ValidationErrors)

+ Converters.newDefaultRegistry() throws exception boolean->Boolean already registered.
This is because EmptyConverter is TwoWayConverter. Remove boolean->Boolean converter registration.

+ PropertyValueAdapter - the only usage is to provide class and property name.
  It would be very convenient to create adapter for existing object.
  Now we are forced to do the following:

    Object bean = ...
    PropertyValueAdapter model = PropertyValueAdapter.newFromBean(bean.getClass(), "property1");
    model.setContext(bean);

    // now model is ready to use

  Wanted:
    PropertyValueAdapter model = PropertyValueAdapter.newFromBean(bean, "property1");
    PropertyValueAdapter model = PropertyValueAdapter.newFromClass(bean.getClass(), "property1");

    also rename newFromBean(Class beanClass, String property) to newFromClass(Class beanClass, String property)
    as shown above


+ provide simple implementation of ValueModel. It will be useful in tests.

- provide SendParams.create() for symmetry with SendParams.empty()

- ConverterRegistry. Add MappingKey.toString() returning source and target class names. For easy debugging.
